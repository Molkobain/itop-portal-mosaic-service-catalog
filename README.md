## Description
This extension changes the default view mode of the service catalog within the portal, to *mosaic* (similar to Windows 8).
* This mode is much more efficient and user friendly if you have a small number of services and service subcategories.
* In this case, you can display icons, which if well chosen, are understood more rapidly than a text.
* Navigation on small devices is also easier with this mode.
